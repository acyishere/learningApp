**Member:** Kadir Kalkan, Group 1, Online Learning Project (OLP), [Personal Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Kadir-Kalkan)

**Responsibilities:** I was responsible for learning how to use Django and dockerize the Django application. After the learning process, my task was dockerizing the Django application. Additionally, I was responsible to learn Django Rest Framework. Besides, one of my tasks was to find a tutorial to implement login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Main Contributions:** Following [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) tutorial, I learned how to construct a Django application and developed a basic Django application. I then dockerized this application. I built a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to dockerize the Django application. Then I presented the dockerized application to my teammates and then we decided to deploy this version of the project. After the dockerization and deployment process to connect the backend to the frontend and android, we decided to use Django Rest Framework. It was my responsibility to add the rest API feature to our application. I have learned how to use the Django Rest Framework and added this feature to our application. After that, we decided to push our project to Github. I created a new Django application with proper application and project names. Then dockerized this application and added the Rest Framework feature. Then we pushed this project to Github. Finally, we had to create login, logout, and register functionalities for our application. For that purpose, we first needed to learn how to implement these functionalities. I searched and tried lots of tutorials to implement these functionalities. Finally, I found [this](https://studygyaan.com/django/django-rest-framework-tutorial-register-login-logout) tutorial and suggested to the backend team to follow this tutorial. We followed this tutorial and implemented login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Responsibilities:** 
  
* I was responsible for designing homepage page. 
* I was responsible for reviewing my team member's work.
* I was responsible for distribution of the work to be done each member. 
* I was responsible to help my team if they needed.
* I was responsible to follow what the rest of the team has done.


**Main Contributions:** 
* I have implemented home-page for Web.
* I struggled with understanding the login and sign up part. I fixed them.
* I made the api connections of the login,logout,register and sign up pages.
* I did research to show my teammates beautiful website designs.
* I did research on deployment of the project.
* I created the Dockerfile.
* I compared website designs and chose the most suitable one with my group friends.
* I participated into the all group meetings both Frontend and overall team.
* I built the Reactjs project structure. I designed the folder structure. I adjusted the project accordingly.
* I also handled the token based system. 
* I reviewed my team member's work.
* I helped my friends with reactjs. I helped them when they had problems.
* I introduced Frontend,Android and Backend label to our repository.
* I created the profile page. When I log in, I set it to go to the profile page with that token. With that token, I set it to logout and go to the homepage again. I set the profile page checking for the existence of the token. Ece filled out the profile part.
* I made the necessary preparations for the deployment part. I worked it from this [site](https://jsramblings.com/dockerizing-a-react-app/). I asked my friends to fulfill their responsibilities. I waited for them to do it. If they won't, I told them to tell me that I would do the deployment part accordingly. There was no answer. I wrote the Dockerfile. @Ege did the deployment part. During this process, we had these problems because of my teammates not helping us.
* Normally we would deploy as a team. Then when no one was interested, I wanted to do it. Last night, I told my friends to wait if they are going to fulfill their responsibilities, and if they are not, let's deploy now. None answered. So, the deployment is in trouble. 
* In simple, I had to prepare homepage, profile, redirection between pages, folder structure, and token based authorization(login-logout system and related redirections).

**Member:** Ege Onur Tağa, Group 1, Online Learning Project (OLP), [Personal Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Ege-Onur-Taga)

**Responsibilities:** I was responsible for the dockerization and deployment for the OLP. Moreover, I have implemented login, logout, change-password functionalities, together with writing test cases for register, login and logout. Also, I was responsible for editing glossary and requirement pages. Additonally, I was responsible for  presentation slides and also preparing the scenarios for the customer meeting. 

**Main Contributions:** I have implemented login, logout and change password functionalities. Moreover, I dockerized the backend project and deployed into AWS EC2 instance. Additionally I prepared a presentation and a scenario for the customer meeting. Another important thing I did is to edit the glossary and requirements for the project. Moreover, I reviewed and edited the semantic searching page.

**Additional Information:**
Although initially not my responsibility, I had taken more roles than assumed in the implementation and in the deployment parts. I should have been responsible for deployment and a one back-end functionality only. Yet, since one of our friends in the backend team had a family related urgency, I had assumed most of the implementation parts. Moreover, we couldn't implement the e-mail authentication part of the backend, because we had shortage of people. We will be implementing it from now on.

## Executive Summary

The application, budemi is a non-conventional online learning platform, where the users learn and teach at their own will, separating the application from conventional learning platforms like udemy or coursera. The most basic thing to do at such a project is to first revise requirements, diagrams (UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams etc.) and plan the future of project accordingly by a project plan. Accordingly, we have created a project plan for each team as project plan for backend, project plan for frontend and project plan for mobile. The reason for 3 project plans is for giving autonomy to each team at their development. Moreover, backend team should be one step ahead to allow frontend and mobile teams to to experiment with their endpoints. This also creates a window where backend team can revise their endpoints in case of any problem realized in the frontend or android.

For the first milestone, our aim was to implement and deploy basic authorization schemes and make the frontend and mobile applications and backend application communicate with each other. This aim is realized at a certain extend. Backend and mobile teams successfully deployed their product and made the communication with one another in a very efficient way. However, there were problems in frontend connection and deployment. Our application has registration, login, logout and change password functionalities.

The frontend team has communicated with the rest of the team to explain the reasons for this. And the team has decided that giving more stricter and well-defined roles and deadlines to each member of the frontend team. For the second milestone, we as a team believe that we will be more efficient in our communication and deployment and support the frontend team as a whole.

Although problems rise in real life, they are also informative and we should also feel lucky to learn from these problems rather than feel stucked or frustrated.

## Evaluation of Deliverables
#### **Software Requirements Specification**
We have done our software requirement specifications on the previous course (352). However, we needed to improve and change some of them as we go along with the new semester (451). Changes were necessarry because we added new features, deleted unnecessary information.

#### **Software Design (UML):Use-Case Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram**
We also have done Use-Case Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram before we started the implementation of the project to see which classes we need, how the interaction between the code, ui and user is going to be. We have improved the diagrams as we go on with the project and fixed some errors as our professor or TA suggested. 

#### **Software Design (UML):Scenarios and Mockups**
We had Scenarios and Mockups at the last semester. However, we needed to also make a new one because we now have an android app as well. Definitions, requirements have also changed and improved. We have created a new persona, showed it on presentation, and made a new mockup for the parts of the project we have finished for Milestone 1.

#### **Project Plan Android**
As Android team, we have created our project plan gradually instead of over a night. We first choose our communication channel which is discord. Secondly, we choose which language is best in slot for android studio. We decided on kotlin. We then started distributing tasks (main page, landing, logoff...). We made a plan for reviewing and bugfixing the code. And at last moving on to deliverables.
#### *Project Plan Frontend*
The first element in the project plan is the members responsible for the frontend development. Then, the responsibilities are assigned while keeping the development in other teams in mind. 
#### *Project Plan Backend*
We started by deciding who would be on the backend team. We conducted weekly meetings to finish the work in the project's backend. The tasks that needed to be completed were assigned to each group member. All group members completed their tasks up to now, and we created a deployed backend application.
#### *Individual Contribution reports*
Individual Contribution Reports have been completed with every one of our group members' efforts since the beginning of the semester. All the team members provided the necessary hyperlinks and references to their works including issues' links and pull requests' links. It includes a detailed summary of the work completed so far this semester.
#### *Backend Software*
As the backend team, we developed our project using Django. We have used the Django Rest Framework feature to create REST API. Additionally, we used Docker to containerize our backend application. Finally, we deployed the backend application using an AWS EC2 instance. 
#### *Frontend Software*
The frontend team has written their software using react. The docker is used to containerize the front end and then the frontend app is deployed into AWS EC2 instance. 
#### *Android Software*
As the Android team, we used kotlin as our main language for android development and android studio as our ide. We decided to use retrofit library for api calls. Each tool choice we have made was the best for us because we were able to develop our app without an issue.
#### *Group Review*
As a group, all of the subsections of this document are assumed by group members and filled accordingly. For the review, we have talked among ourselves and discussed the way of working after milestone 1, our inadequacies and how can we address them. Hence we hope that this document will be useful in evaluating our contributions to the project.

## Evaluation of Tools and Processes

### Evaluation of Tools 
This semester, the choice of communication and development tools gained significant importance since we develop a more comprehensive project. We are divided into sub-groups, the amount of code we delivered increased and features got more complicated. The tools and processes we adapted should meet our needs, or else it would have made our lives harder.

#### **1. Discord**
We used Discord as our main meeting platform. We have created text and voice channels for subgroups as well. Sometimes it helped us to hold concurrent meetings going on at different channels. Threads, the screen sharing feature, and easy file exchange were some of the reasons we chose it as a communication channel. Even though Zoom appears to be having an easier user interface, it does not meet our needs. Starting a call is faster and easier than Zoom without need any link to connect and waiting time, just with a one click you will be online in the meeting. Discord keeps messages and files organized and any team member can see what was posted on the channels. This causes easiness to reach archieved sources. So, no one doesn't need to spend his/her time to explain what was shared before to newcomers. In addition, Discord emphasizes while we would insert a code snippet and makes it easy-to-copy. Messages can be edited and pinned, this makes keep to meeting decisions up-to-date and well formed. Last but not least, messages can be edited just by who sent it, and this feature provides safeness of messages and prevents removing messages by accident. It could be mentioned as a drawback that its updates take too much time, especially when we are in a hurry.


#### **2. WhatsApp**
Even though we are all senior computer engineering students, we are not always online on our PCs. Most of the time we are mobile and we don't pay attention to our email notifications and Discord messages. Still, there are times we need an immediate response from our group members, especially when we are short on time for a deadline. For this kind of situations, we have used our WhatsApp group chat. It could be overwhelming to keep all conversations there. However, it is essential for emergencies or for deciding on a place&time for the next meeting, where everyone should tell their opinion and everyone should attend.

#### **3. GitHub**
GitHub is the most important tool for our project in so many aspects. First, we use GitHub repository to store the product source code, and the other deliverables. Also, we track our tasks via the issue system, which is working great for us because we are used to using it from CmpE 352 semester. We keep our meeting notes, diagrams, all related research, and old reports as Wiki pages. We develop on our own branches, commit, and then send pull requests to merge our code into a closer branch to the master branch. Committing mentality makes codes clear and more understandable to review what have been done so far. Commit message feauture is very essential at this point: if it is applied in a proper way, everything will be more clearer for contributors of same code. Merging is also need to be comprehend well because solving conflicts and giving feedbacks on code while merging is very crucial for code safety and compatibleness. Branching is also need to be handled well to develop partial and task-based developments on projects otherwise everything becomes confused. GitHub makes it easier to review code, reject/allow requests, and keep everything organized in short.

#### **4. React.JS**
As the frontend team, we decided to develop the Web application with React. The reasons were manyfold. Its simplicity allowed us to learn it in a short amount of time. None of us had experience in React before, but we were able to learn it following some courses on other learning platforms. Before jumping right into developing Budemi, we all prepared React demo project and told each other about the setup and development processes. It being component-based made it easy to comprehend as well. Since it is a widely-used library by the front-end community, there are many resources to learn, and also refer to, when we encounter a difficulty.

#### **5. Django**
As the backend team, we developed our project using Django. We made such a decision because we were overall more experienced in Django than in other frameworks. We knew that starting a project in Django requires more work than an average framework (we considered Flask mainly). However, because learning a new framework is a cost too, we selected Django. As we predicted, starting a new project and app in Django takes effort. However, Django's oficial documentation is very well written (while very long) and following the steps in documentation is enough to build the project without a problem. Since Django is written in Python, it is developer friendly. Adding a new functionality takes less lines, time and effort. Moreover, it is a pretty mature freamwork. It is less likely not to be able to do something in Django.

#### **6. Docker**
Docker is one of the must-be technologies for software development. In our project, it made our job easier while deploying the project. While initializing the project we used local development but after dockerize the project, we switched to Docker development. Docker development helps run the same project without unexpected problems on every (team member's and server) computer. That prevents lots of "it was working on my computer" kinds of problems and is very beneficial in the long run.

### **7. Android Studio**
Android is the best platform (IDE) to develop Android apps. Android Studio supported everything we need. To design our front-end, we sometimes pick and drop the views and sometimes we editted corresponding .xml file to give the design that we want. To make back-end connection we used retrofit library which is the most commonly industry proved used library for kotlin language. In the future, we plan to stick with the Android Studio.

---------

## Requirements

For this milestone, we have focused on the authentication part of requirements and also run the app both on the backend, mobile and the frontend. We have implemented all of them except the password recovery, which is addressed in 1.1.1.4.2.
