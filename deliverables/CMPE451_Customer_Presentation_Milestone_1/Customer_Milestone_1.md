I defined new branches name and creating new branches to speed up the development process and develop more stable codes. I created 3 new branches for this: android_main, android_test, and android_dev. I have dealt with Scenario & Mockups creating the Scenario and Mockup slides with my teammate Ömer Özdemir, Ahmet Yazıcı. I have also designed the sign-in page of the app, I have designed the login page, By assigning the token I received from the backend to a global value, I ensured that the user was logged in or not.

**Member:** Kadir Kalkan, Group 1, Online Learning Project (OLP), [Personal Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Kadir-Kalkan)

**Responsibilities:** I was responsible for learning how to use Django and dockerize the Django application. After the learning process, my task was dockerizing the Django application. Additionally, I was responsible to learn Django Rest Framework. Besides, one of my tasks was to find a tutorial to implement login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Main Contributions:** Following [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) tutorial, I learned how to construct a Django application and developed a basic Django application. I then dockerized this application. I built a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to dockerize the Django application. Then I presented the dockerized application to my teammates and then we decided to deploy this version of the project. After the dockerization and deployment process to connect the backend to the frontend and android, we decided to use Django Rest Framework. It was my responsibility to add the rest API feature to our application. I have learned how to use the Django Rest Framework and added this feature to our application. After that, we decided to push our project to Github. I created a new Django application with proper application and project names. Then dockerized this application and added the Rest Framework feature. Then we pushed this project to Github. Finally, we had to create login, logout, and register functionalities for our application. For that purpose, we first needed to learn how to implement these functionalities. I searched and tried lots of tutorials to implement these functionalities. Finally, I found [this](https://studygyaan.com/django/django-rest-framework-tutorial-register-login-logout) tutorial and suggested to the backend team to follow this tutorial. We followed this tutorial and implemented login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Additional Information:**
Although initially not my responsibility, I had taken more roles than assumed in the implementation and in the deployment parts. I should have been responsible for deployment and a one back-end functionality only. Yet, since one of our friends in the backend team had a family related urgency, I had assumed most of the implementation parts. Moreover, we couldn't implement the e-mail authentication part of the backend, because we had shortage of people. We will be implementing it from now on.
