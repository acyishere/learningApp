**Responsibilities:** I Defined sdk version, android studio version and creating the first project from template. I defined new branches name and creating new branches to speed up the development process and develop more stable codes. I created 3 new branches for this: android_main, android_test, and android_dev. I have dealt with Scenario & Mockups creating the Scenario and Mockup slides with my teammate Ömer Özdemir, Ahmet Yazıcı. I have also designed the sign-in page of the app, I have designed the login page, By assigning the token I received from the backend to a global value, I ensured that the user was logged in or not. I also took part in the reviewing process for some of my teammates’ pull requests and issues. I introduced retrofit library for our use from now on for api requests with Ömer Özdemir. I participated in writing the android mockup scenario for milestone 1.

**Main Contributions:** Determining which tools to use while doing the project. I have implemented the xml and activity file of sign-in page, found example png files on google and put on drawables. I enabled the user to login by sending a request to the back-end. I have reviewed and merged several files, made several pull requests for my own changes. I also bugfixed my friends code, solved the errors. I defined new branches name and creating new branches to speed up the development process and develop more stable codes.

Also, I was responsible for editing glossary and requirement pages. Additonally, I was responsible for  presentation slides and also preparing the scenarios for the customer meeting. 

**Main Contributions:** I have implemented login, logout and change password functionalities. Moreover, I dockerized the backend project and deployed into AWS EC2 instance. Additionally I prepared a presentation and a scenario for the customer meeting. Another important thing I did is to edit the glossary and requirements for the project. Moreover, I reviewed and edited the semantic searching page.

**Additional Information:**
Although initially not my responsibility, I had taken more roles than assumed in the implementation and in the deployment parts. I should have been responsible for deployment and a one back-end functionality only. Yet, since one of our friends in the backend team had a family related urgency, I had assumed most of the implementation parts. Moreover, we couldn't implement the e-mail authentication part of the backend, because we had shortage of people. We will be implementing it from now on.
