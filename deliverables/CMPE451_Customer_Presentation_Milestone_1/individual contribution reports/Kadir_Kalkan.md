**Responsibilities:** I was responsible for learning how to use Django and dockerize the Django application. After the learning process, my task was dockerizing the Django application. Additionally, I was responsible to learn Django Rest Framework. Besides, one of my tasks was to find a tutorial to implement login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Main Contributions:** Following [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) tutorial, I learned how to construct a Django application and developed a basic Django application. I then dockerized this application. I built a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to dockerize the Django application. Then I presented the dockerized application to my teammates and then we decided to deploy this version of the project. After the dockerization and deployment process to connect the backend to the frontend and android, we decided to use Django Rest Framework. It was my responsibility to add the rest API feature to our application. I have learned how to use the Django Rest Framework and added this feature to our application. After that, we decided to push our project to Github. I created a new Django application with proper application and project names. Then dockerized this application and added the Rest Framework feature. Then we pushed this project to Github. Finally, we had to create login, logout, and register functionalities for our application. For that purpose, we first needed to learn how to implement these functionalities. I searched and tried lots of tutorials to implement these functionalities. Finally, I found [this](https://studygyaan.com/django/django-rest-framework-tutorial-register-login-logout) tutorial and suggested to the backend team to follow this tutorial. We followed this tutorial and implemented login, logout, and register functionalities.
