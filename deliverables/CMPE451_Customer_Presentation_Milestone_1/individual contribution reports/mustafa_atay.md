**Additional Information:**
I had been working on this project and fulfilling my responsibilities as expected since the beginning of the class. I took further responsibility while creating initial Django project and application. However, I had a family-related urgency last week of the Milestone 1 deadline (27.10.2022 - 30.10.2022) and had to return to my family house. Unfortunately, I couldn't contribute a lot during that period.
