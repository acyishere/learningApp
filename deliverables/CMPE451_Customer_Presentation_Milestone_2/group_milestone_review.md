# Executive summary

As of now, we have a functional backend and android, which communicate with each other. On the backend side, most of the functionalities are implemented. What is lacking is annotations. The android team managed to connect with these functionalities and presented a working application. What is lacking in android app is style. Now, they concentrate on improving the design of the app. On the frontend side, things went quite bad. In milestone 2, the frontend team couldn't finish their implementations. They have a functional login, register, home pages and content pages. But, the learning space pages are not implemented. 


In the milestone 1, we had problematic frontend. The members of the frontend team, who didn't satisfy their roles at the time, promised to be more organized and follow a structured plan. In backend side, the backend team decided to split the tasks among each others from the beginning. In this manner, they implemented their tasks more effectively. In the android, they split the tasks as well. This improved the overall progress in the implementation.  

Due to the slowness in progress in the frontend, we decided to assign Mustafa Atay to frontend team. Also, the core tasks in backend (aside from annotations) are finished. So, the frontend team needed Mustafa's assistance more than the backend. In this milestone, as a team we decided not to assign tasks to the team members who didn't do their roles in milestone 1 and 2. This is because, their not holding their promises affects our whole progress and prevents the team to finish the tasks. At every week, we decided to see progress in frontend. In its current form, if necessary efforts are made, it is not that difficult to give a reasonable UI in the frontend. On the backend, the team decided to focus on annotations and improvements in the image uploading. On android, the team decided to improve the app's design.     

I sincerely believe that we as a team could manage to present a nice, working learning platform.

## Annotations

We haven't started implementing the Annotations into the project for this Milestone. In the following weeks, we are going to implement Annotations on text and images for the content pages.

## Standards

As we did not implement annotations yet, we did not have a chance to use W3C standards in implementing web annotations. In the following weeks, we will implement the annotations fully suiting the W3C standards. Apart from that, backend team writes their APIs as suiting REST standards: hence they write REST APIs. Such a suiting to REST standards facilitate mobile and frontend's adoption to our endpoints.

**Responsibilities:** I was assigned: Preparing a sidebar, a page for changing password, a list displaying learning spaces and creating learning space functionality for Android application. Other than these, I was responsible for reviewing other teammates works, issues, pull requests and helping them.

**Main Contributions:** I have created a sidebar for displaying main categories of learning spaces, namely: Art, Science, Math, Technology and Engineering. I implemented a page displays learning spaces according to the selected category from the sidebar. I added learning space create functionality to this page. Omer and I provided a structure about API requests authorization and parameters for following at the rest of the project. I made the API connection of previosly designed Change Password page. I prepared a page for resetting forgotten passwords and connected it to the Sign In page. I prepared a search page for learning spaces and directed users from the home page. I generated the APK of our application.

**Unit Tests:** I haven't implemented any unit tests.

**Additional Information:** We had many meetings during the development process and helped each others a lot. We splitted works should be done until the milestone 2 during these meetings, but some pages were not implemented. As a team we tried to complete those pages, for me, I implemented forgot, change password page and search page for learning spaces additionally. Further, we could have been more prepared for the milestone2. We will try harder for the next milestone.

**Member:** Harun ERKURT, Group1, Android, Online Learning Project (OLP), [Personal Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Harun-Erkurt)

**Responsibilities:** Preparing a homepage, preparing a splash screen, making the relevant settings on android studio. Developing a new architecture because the existing architecture has shortcomings.

**Main Contributions:** I developed a new architecture to strengthen the communication of the application with the backend, to reduce the errors that can be received and to develop better code. I also uploaded these codes to the android_main branch. I prepared the design for the home page and prepared the splash screen. Since I haven't been able to combine the codes of my other friends yet, we didn't show it during the presentation, but we will show it in the milestone 3 presentation.

#### a. Code Related Significant Issues:
* Development of Homepage: [Issue #542](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/issues/542)
* Development of new architecture for mobile application, making splash screen, Creating a homepage for application, integrating open source codes and libraries that can be used in the application: [Issue #639](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/issues/639)


#### a. Management Related Significant Issues:
* Customer meeting evaluation: [Issue #503](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/issues/503)

* Meeting with Android team: [Issue #544](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/issues/544)

**Pull Requests:**


**Unit Tests:** I haven't implemented any unit tests.

**Additional Information:** I tried to develop a new architecture for android because the existing application had a lot of bugs and it was prolonging the code development process. Like other groups, a new architecture was needed for a better and more beautiful-looking application, but there was not enough time to migrate all the code to the existing architecture before the presentation. However, I have uploaded my enhancements to the android_main branch.

- I was responsible for writing API endpoints part of Milestone 2.

**Main Contributions:**

- I implemented POST method for the learning space endpoint.
- I implemented get enrolled learning spaces, leave learning space, profile, forget password endpoints . Profile endpoint provides POST and GET methods. Leave learning space and forget password endpoints only provide POST method.
